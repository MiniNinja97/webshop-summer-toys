Hi, my name is Emma – I'm so glad you found your way here!

This is an individual school project. We're currently taking a course in React and have been assigned to build a toy store focused on summer toys.

There are a few requirements we need to follow, such as using: React, Joi, React Router (with HashRouter), 
a state manager (Zustand, Context, or Redux), and Firestore.
The webshop must be responsive, display at least 20 different products, and include form validation.
We’ve been given two weeks to complete the assignment.

So come along on my little React adventure and explore my colorful toy store — you might just find something that brings out that summer feeling!

Take a look — it’ll be fun!







# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
