Hi, my name is Emma – I'm so glad you found your way here! 😊

This is an individual school project. We're currently taking a course in React and have been assigned to build a toy store focused on summer toys. ☀️🧸

There are a few requirements we need to follow, such as using: React, Joi, React Router (with HashRouter), 
a state manager (Zustand, Context, or Redux), and Firestore. 
The webshop must be responsive, display at least 20 different products, and include form validation.🛒✅

We’ve been given two weeks to complete the assignment.⏳

So come along on my little React adventure and explore my colorful toy store — you might just find something that brings out that summer feeling!

Take a look — it’ll be fun!🎉







# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
